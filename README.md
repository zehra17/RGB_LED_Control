## RGB LED Control with a Potentiometer
**Description:** A project to control the colors of an RGB LED using a potentiometer.

### Hardware:
- Arduino board
- RGB LED
- Resistors (appropriate values for the LED)
- Potentiometer
- Jumper wires

### Software:
- Arduino IDE

### How to Use:
1. Connect the RGB LED to the specified pins (`11`, `10`, `9` for Red, Green, and Blue) on the Arduino.
2. Connect the potentiometer to pin `A0` to read its value.
3. Upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
4. Turn the potentiometer to change the LED colors based on the input range.
